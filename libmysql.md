tagline: MySQL client library

libmysql is the official mysql client library that you can use with
the [mysql] binding.

__Alternative description:__ Libmysql is a 6 (six) Megabyte pile of C++
for what is essentially a networking protocol. It will infect all your
code with GPL, and is also a blocking API. All in all, a marvelous
piece of engineering. Well, you can at least solve the GPL problem
with [libmariadb], which mostly works, with some exceptions,
see mysql_test.lua.
